## Project Spec  
[https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/M2-static-comp-challenge.html](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/M2-static-comp-challenge.html)

## Setup
1. Fork + clone down this repo
1. `cd` into the directory
1. Install the library dependencies with `npm install`
1. To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see a page with the Turing logo image and a beautiful gradient background. If that's the case, you're good to go.
2. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

## Specification

This static comp challenge will keep you exercising that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate the image below by recreating the screenshot using HTML and CSS.

In other static comp challenges (but not this one), we'll give you a bit of flexibility, however the objective is to build something that **very closely** represents the original design.

Once you get into the workforce, building out comps that reflect the designer's choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail, is a requirement.

## The Challenge

Your challenge is to recreate the following image using HTML and CSS. You've been given some initial files to get started that you must use.
